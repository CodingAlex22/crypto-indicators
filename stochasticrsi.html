            <h1>Stohastic RSI</h1> 
            <p>Stochastic RSI considers the relative strength index (RSI) and applies stochastic oscillator formula to it, deriving market trends that are more sensitive than RSI alone. It is a technical indicator built through the combination of stochastic oscillator formula and relative strength index (RSI) and ranges between 0 to 100.

                Stochastic RSI allows traders to identify whether an asset is in the overbought (80) or oversold (20) territory.
                
                Since Stochastic RSI is derived from RSI itself, it makes absolute sense to understand the concept. Basically, the RSI is a technical indicator that tracks an assetâ€™s momentum, identifying whether the cryptocurrency is overbought or oversold.
                
                Typically the RSI is measured between 0 to 100, with values above 70 indicating overbought and values below 30 reflecting oversold positions. The upshot? It represents a signal for the direction and the strength of the trend.  
            </p>
            <h2>How to use Stohastic RSI</h2>
            <p>The same principles with Stohastic RSI apply the same as with RSI. The only different is that 80 (0.08 on the chart below) is overbought
                territory while 20 (0.08 on the chart below) is oversold territory
