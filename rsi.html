            <h1>RSI</h1> 
            <p>The RSI (Relative Strength Index) is a tool that helps traders understand if a cryptocurrency is overbought or oversold. Essentially, it looks at how much the price of a cryptocurrency has changed over time, and gives a number between 0 and 100 that shows how strong the buying or selling pressure is. If the RSI is above 70, it means that the price might be overbought and due for a correction, while an RSI below 30 could indicate that the price is oversold and might be due for a rebound. The RSI is displayed as a line graph that moves up and down between two extremes. It was developed by J. Welles Wilder, a famous trader and author, and is widely used by traders to help them make better decisions about when to buy or sell cryptocurrencies.

            <h2>How to use RSI</h2>
            <p>A crypto asset is said to be overbought when the RSI is above 70. At this point, the bullish trend is due for a correction. On the other hand, when it is below 30, the price is considered to be oversold, due for a rebound.

                In a strong uptrend, the Relative Strength Index will frequently reach 70 or even higher for extended periods, whereas, in a downtrend, it may remain at 30 or below for an extended length of time. Traders can use the RSI to determine when to buy at oversold levels in a bullish trend. However, in a bearish trend, they look for selling opportunities when the price becomes overbought.
                
                RSI level of above 50 indicates more buying momentum and shows stronger buying power in the market. On the other hand, a reading below 50 indicates more bearish power. You can always analyze the price activity around the 50-level to know when a bullish or bearish trend is about to change.
