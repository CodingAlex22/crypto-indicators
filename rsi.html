            <h1>RSI</h1> 
            <p>The RSI is a momentum indicator used in technical analysis. This indicator examines the magnitude of recent price fluctuations to determine whether or not the price of a cryptocurrency is overbought or oversold.

                The momentum oscillator, a line graph oscillating between two extremes, reads anywhere from 0 to 100. J. Welles Wilder invented it in his groundbreaking book New Concepts in Technical Trading Systems, published in 1978.

            <h2>How to use RSI</h2>
            <p>A crypto asset is said to be overbought when the RSI is above 70. At this point, the bullish trend is due for a correction. On the other hand, when it is below 30, the price is considered to be oversold, due for a rebound.

                In a strong uptrend, the Relative Strength Index will frequently reach 70 or even higher for extended periods, whereas, in a downtrend, it may remain at 30 or below for an extended length of time. Traders can use the RSI to determine when to buy at oversold levels in a bullish trend. However, in a bearish trend, they look for selling opportunities when the price becomes overbought.
                
                RSI level of above 50 indicates more buying momentum and shows stronger buying power in the market. On the other hand, a reading below 50 indicates more bearish power. You can always analyze the price activity around the 50-level to know when a bullish or bearish trend is about to change.
