            <h1>Moving Averages</h1> 
            <p>The most popular moving average(MA) indicators among crypto traders are 20MA, 50MA, and 200MA. Weak trends tend to follow
                20MA, mid trends follow 50MA and strong trends follow 200MA. Moving Averages are dynamic (moving) indicators that simply get the average
                of the closing price of the the last 20, 50 and 200 candle sticks. 
            </p>
            <h2>Exponential Moving Averages</h2>
            <p>Exponential Moving Averages (EMA) is the 2nd most widely used technical indicator when it comes to moving averages and stock charts.
                EMAs give more weight to recent prices and are calculated by applying a percentage of today's closing price to yesterday's moving 
                average.
            </p>
            <p>In other words, Moving Averages are used for the long term, Exponential Moving averages are used for short term. Sometimes traders will
                mix the two indicators to create a long/short signal as shown in the chart. Generally indicators are more accuate when applied
                to higher time frames.</p>
