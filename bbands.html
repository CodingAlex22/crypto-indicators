            <h1>Bollinger Bands</h1> 
            <p>Bollinger Bands are a popular technical analysis tool used to understand the volatility of a particular asset or security. They are created by plotting a simple moving average of the asset's price and two bands above and below it, which represent the asset's standard deviation.
            Bollinger Bands are effective at identifying periods of high and low volatility in the market, making them useful for traders looking to time their trades. When the price of the asset crosses above the upper band, it is considered overbought, while when it crosses below the lower band, it is considered oversold.
            These indicators are easy to understand and interpret visually, making them popular among traders of all skill levels. Additionally, they can be applied to any underlying asset, making them versatile in their application. However, it's important to note that Bollinger Bands tend to work better in a sideways market, and traders should be mindful of when to use them. Overall, Bollinger Bands are a powerful tool for traders seeking to understand market volatility and make informed trading decisions.

            <h2>How to use Bollinger Bands</h2>
            <p>The general rule of thumb for Bollinger Bands is that once the price reaches an upper band, it usually means it is a bullish signal. Meanwhile if the price touches the lower band, it means
                that it's time to sell. Look at the chart for buy and sell signals as a reference.
