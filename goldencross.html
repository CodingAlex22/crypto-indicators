            <h1>Golden Cross</h1> 
            <p>A so-called “golden cross” occurs when a short-term MA and a major, long-term MA cross over toward the upside. A golden cross suggests a price rise and an upward turn in the market.
                The short-term MA moves upward much faster than the long-term MA until market conditions push them to cross. In terms of simple moving averages, golden crosses occur when the 50-day SMA 
                crosses above the 200-day SMA, indicating a definitive uptrend.
            </p>
            <h2>Death Cross</h2>
            <p>Compared to the golden cross, a death cross involves a downside MA crossover. This marks a definitive market downturn and typically occurs when the short-term MA trends down, crossing the long-term MA. 

                Simply put, it’s the exact opposite of the golden cross. A death cross is usually read as a bearish signal. The 50-day MA typically crosses below the 200-day MA, signaling a downtrend.
                
                Three phases mark a death cross. The first occurs during an uptrend when the short-term MA is still above the long-term MA. The second phase is characterized by a reversal, during which the short-term 
                MA crosses below the long-term MA. This is followed by the start of a downtrend as the short-term MA continues to move downward, staying below the long-term MA. 
            </p>
            <p>In other words, Moving Averages are used for the long term, Exponential Moving averages are used for short term. Sometimes traders will
                mix the two indicators to create a long/short signal as shown in the chart. Generally indicators are more accuate when applied
                to higher time frames.</p>
