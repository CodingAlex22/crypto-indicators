            <h1>MACD</h1> 
            <p>The Moving Average Convergence-Divergence indicator (MACD) is a model that follows the momentum of trends by 
                showing the relationship between two moving averages of the price of a security. You can insert any moving average
                 into this model that suits your fancy, and it back-tests well on cryptocurrencies on 4h or 1d. On a trading chart, the MACD was designed to 
                 use exponential moving averages of 26 and 12 days.
            </p>
            <h2>How to use the MACD indicator</h2>
            <p> 
                When the MACD line moves above the base line, it signals an uptrend.
    When the MACD line dips below the zero line, it indicates a downtrend.
When the MACD line crosses above the signal line, it is an indication
for traders to buy. This crossover is also referred to as a bullish
MACD crossover, implying that price might start to increase.
When the MACD line moves below the signal line, it is called a bearish MACD crossover, hinting that prices might start to decline. Typically, traders use it as an indication to sell.
A bullish MACD divergence takes place when the price action is trending downwards and the MACD line is indicating higher bottoms, giving a strong bullish signal. Usually, a price starts a strong upward movement after a bullish MACD divergence.
A bearish MACD divergence occurs when the price is rising and the MACD line is creating lower tops, suggesting that the price might move in a bearish direction. Often, a quick bearish move will follow a bearish MACD divergence.
It is an overbought MACD when the MACD line moves a relatively big distance from the signal line. The expectation is that the bullish trend will start to dwindle after the strong increase followed by a bearish trend.
The oversold MACD signal occurs when the MACD line secures a relatively significant distance from the signal line. The price is expected to stop decreasing and start increasing.
